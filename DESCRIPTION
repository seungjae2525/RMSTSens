Package: RMSTSens
Version: 1.0.0
Title: Sensitivity analysis for unmeasured confounding in estimating the difference in restricted mean survival time
Description: RMSTSens is a package aimed at providing a novel sensitivity analysis method for the RMST difference when unmeasured confounding is suspected. Given a user-specified sensitivity parameter, the sensitivity range of the difference in adjusted RMST is calculated with the percentile bootstrap confidence interval for the population sensitivity range.
